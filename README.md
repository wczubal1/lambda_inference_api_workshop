# This is repository for Witold Czubala for Agent X competition

#This was run on Lambda inference using API. If you plan to run it on Lambda you just need your API keys otherwise you need to reconfigure connection to work with different provider


## Prerequisites
- Lambda API Key (you can create one in the [Lambda Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.lambda.ai))

## Initial Setup

1. Create and setup your `.env` file:
```bash
touch .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the following configuration:
```env
# Your Lambda API Keys (get these from https://cloud.lambda.ai)
LAMBDA_INFERENCE_API_KEY=your_lambda_api_key
LAMBDA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_lambda_api_key

# API Endpoints (do not change these)
LAMBDA_INFERENCE_API_BASE=https://api.lambda.ai/v1
LAMBDA_CLOUD_API_BASE=https://cloud.lambda.ai/api/v1

# Default configuration
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama-4-scout
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# SSH Key Name (create this in the Lambda Cloud Dashboard)
SSH_KEY_NAME=your_ssh_key_name
```

Make sure to replace:
- `your_lambda_api_key` with your actual Lambda API key
- `your_ssh_key_name` with the name of your SSH key from the Lambda Cloud Dashboard

## Installation (assumes you have setup the .env above)

### Run locally with Virtual Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Start the code:
```bash
python coinflip.py #calculates and stores coinflip results for DSV3
python coinflip_regex.py #calculates and stores coinflip results for DSR1 including COT first and final generated result
python coin_flips_distribution.py #calculates observed v binomial distribution from coin_flip_results.txt files (generated by coinflip.py and coinflip_regex.py)
python MonteCarloRepeats.py #Runs Monte Carlo simulations to compute how likely are the observed repeats
python process_multiple_sims.py #Creates tables with repeats from model reults (generated by coinflip.py and coinflip_regex.py)
python models.py #Lists available models in Lambda (we use DSV3 and DSR1 but you can try this on different model set)

```
